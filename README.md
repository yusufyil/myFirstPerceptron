# myFirstPerceptron
I developed my first perceptron to visualize basic ideas of machine learning
You can change learningRate value to see the difference between slow learning and fast learning bigger learningRate values are going to increase accuracy faster, but it will less make perceptron less accurate in higher percentages.
you need to import pygame to run this code. (To import pygame you should type "pip install pygame" to your terminal)
